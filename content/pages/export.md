      Nepal's unique terroir, high altitudes, and dedicated farmers produce
      exceptional specialty coffee with distinctive flavor profiles. NepCoffee
      is proud to showcase these premium beans to the international market,

      **Information about Nepali Coffee**


      Grown primarily in the mid-hills of Nepal, Nepali Arabica coffee is
      gaining international recognition for its quality and unique
      characteristics. The diverse microclimates and altitudes contribute to
      beans with bright acidity, complex aromas, and a range of flavor notes,
      often exhibiting hints of citrus, floral tones, and sweet caramel. We work
      closely with local farmers and cooperatives, ensuring fair prices and
      sustainable practices to bring the best of Nepali coffee to global
      roasters and consumers.
