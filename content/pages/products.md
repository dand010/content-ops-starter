      *   **Imported Single-Origin Beans:** Sourced from global hubs, these
      might include Ethiopian Yirgacheffe with floral notes, Colombian Supremo
      with rich, caramel undertones, and Brazilian beans known for their nutty
      flavors, catering to Nepal's urban coffee shops and consumers.

      *   **Nepalese Specialty Coffees:** Grown in the Himalayan foothills at
      altitudes of 1,000â€“1,600 meters, these coffees are prized for their bright
      acidity, fruity notes (e.g., citrus, berries), and smooth finish, sourced
      from regions like Nuwakot, Palpa, and Ilam.

      *   **Signature Blends:** Combining imported and local beans, these blends
      would offer balanced flavors for various brewing methods, such as
      espresso, drip, or French press.

      *   **Organic and Fair Trade Options:** Reflecting industry trends,
      NepCoffee would likely offer certified organic and fair trade coffees,
      ensuring ethical sourcing and environmental responsibility.

      *   **Roasted to Order:** All products would be roasted fresh in small
      batches, packaged in eco-friendly, valve-sealed bags to preserve
      freshness, available in whole bean or ground form.


      This diversity aligns with Nepal's coffee consumption, estimated at 250
      metric tons annually, as per [Nepal Outlook - Trend of Coffee Import and
      Export in
      Nepal](https://nepaloutlook.com/trend-of-coffee-import-and-export-in-nepal/),
      and the growing popularity in urban centers.
