      ![](/images/Colombian-coffee-landscape.jpg)


      Renowned for its consistently high-quality Arabica beans, Colombia offers
      a delightful balance of flavor and aroma. Grown in high-altitude regions
      with volcanic soil, Colombian coffee is typically smooth and well-rounded,
      with a medium body and bright, citrus-like acidity.

      *   Medium body


      *   Notes of caramel, nuts, and chocolate

      **Sustainability/Sourcing**


      We work with Colombian producers who often hand-pick their beans, ensuring
      only the ripest cherries are harvested. We prioritize relationships with
      farms practicing sustainable agriculture and fair labor.


      **Origin: Brazil - The World's Largest Producer**


      ![](/images/Brazilian-coffee-landscape.jpg)


      As the world's largest coffee producer, Brazil offers a wide range of
      flavor profiles depending on the region and processing method. Generally,
      Brazilian coffees are known for their smooth body, low acidity, and nutty,
      chocolatey, and caramel notes. Some regions and processing techniques can
      also yield fruity or even slightly boozy flavors.

      *   Smooth body


      *   Low to medium acidity


      *   Nutty and chocolatey notes are common

      ![](/images/Kenyan-coffee.jpg)


      Kenyan coffee is celebrated for its complex and vibrant flavors, often
      described as having a wine-like acidity and a full body. You can expect
      intense flavors with distinct notes of blackcurrant, other berries, and
      sometimes a lemony citrus finish. The high altitudes and volcanic, acidic
      soil contribute to its unique profile.


      **Key Characteristics/Flavor**


      *   Bright, wine-like acidity


      *   Full body


      *   Strong notes of blackcurrant and berries

      wet-processing methods and commitment to quality. We prioritize fair
      prices for farmers and environmentally sound practices.


      **Origin: Indonesia - Earthy and Bold Flavors**


      ***


      Indonesian coffees are prized for their unique flavor profiles, often
      characterized by low acidity, a heavy body, and earthy, woody, and
      sometimes spicy notes. The "Giling Basah" (wet-hulled) processing method,
      particularly in Sumatra, contributes to this distinct character. Other
      islands like Java and Bali offer different nuances, from rustic and sweet
      to clean and mild.


      **Key Characteristics/Flavor**


      *   Low acidity


      *   Heavy body, often syrupy


      *   Earthy and woody notes are common


      *   Hints of spice (e.g., clove, black pepper)


      *   Dark chocolate or tobacco undertones may be present


      **Sustainability/Sourcing**


      We work with cooperatives and estates across the Indonesian archipelago,
      seeking out high-quality beans and supporting sustainable practices,
      including shade-grown coffee and fair trade initiatives.
